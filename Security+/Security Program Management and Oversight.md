# Security Policies
- Security policies answer the "what" and "why" questions. The technical security controls answer "how"

- <us>Information Security Policies</u>: big list of all security guidelines
    - Need to follow compliance requirements
    - Answers the question "What happens when..."
    - They need to be enforced

- <us>Acceptable  use Policies</u>: list of policies that states what users are allowed to do with the given items at their disposal
    - Includes topics like internet use, computers, mobile devices, etc.
    - Used by an organization for legal issues to protect themselves(if needed)

- <us>Business continuity</u>: an alternative plan should the main process is not working properly
    - Needs to be created and tested before an issue occurs

- Incident Response Roles
    - Incident response team
    - IT security management (i.e. corporate support)
    - Compliance officers (i.e. intricate knowledge of compliance rules)
    - Technical staff (i.e. the team doing the fixing)
    - Users

- Change Management
    - This could be software upgrade, change firewall configuration, modify switch ports, etc.


# Security Standards
-  Standards can be custom or already written
    - ISO and NIST are pre-written standards

- Access Control
    - Determines which information and at what time and under what circumstances a user can access something
    - Require privilege documentation

- Physical Security
    - ID cards
    - Escorts
    - Doors, building access, proper security

- Encryption
    - Store passwords in a specific method or technique (i.e. specific hash)
    - Data in transit and data in use need specific encryption compared to encryption for storing passwords


# Security Procedures
- <u>Playbook</u>: step by step processes and procedures for specific situations (i.e. investigate a data breach, recover from ransomware)

- Updating monitoring and revision processes since IT is always changing
    - Update security playbooks
    - Change the individual procedures
    - Protect against new threats


# Security Considerations
- Regulations
    - Regulations are usually mandated (i.e. HIPAA)

- Legal
    - The security team must follow legal guidelines  (i.e. keeping data within a certain region)

- Industry
    - Each industry may require specific security considerations
    - Electrical power an public utilities
    - Medical has high secure data storage and access logs
        - Data encryption and protection


# Data Roles and Responsibilities
- Data Owner
    - They are accountable for specific data. Often a senior officer

- Data Controller
    - Controls how the data will be used (i.e. payroll department)

- Data processor
    - Processes the data from the controller (i.e. payroll company)

- Data custodian/steward
    - Responsible for data accuracy, privacy, and security
    - Works directly with the data


# Risk Management
- Risk management helps to understand potential risks and identify weaknesses before the become an issue


# Risk Analysis
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence
    - It determines how often a risk will happen in 1 year

- Risk appetite
    - Like a highways speed limit
    - Government authorities have set the speed limit. The limit is an acceptable balance between safety and convenience

- Risk Tolerance
    - Drivers will be ticketed when the speed limit is violated
    - Ticketing usually occurs well above the posted limit
    This tolerance can change with road conditions, weather, traffic, etc.


# Risk Management Strategies
- Transfer
    - Move the risk to another party
    - Buy cybersecurity insurance

- Accept
    - Accept the risk

- Accept with exemption
    - A security policy can not be followed

- Accept with exception
    - Internal security policies are not applied

- Risk reporting
    - Document with a list of all the risks the organization is tracking
    - Its for senior management
    - Includes critical and emerging risks


# Business Impact Analysis
<u> Recovery Time Objective</u>: time to get back up and running

<u> Recovery Time Objective</u>: a point int time you can say you are back up and running

<u>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</u>: average time to fix a required issue
    - Includes diagnosing and everything related to fix the issue

<u>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</u>: the time a system will run before another outage


# Third Party Risk Assessment
- Pen testing
    - Its similar to a vulnerability scan
    - Often a compliance mandate
    - A 3rd party can specialize in pen testing
    - The Rules of Engagement defines purpose and scope of a pen test and what is not in scope (i.e. IP addresses, emergency contacts, devices, etc.)

- Right to Audit
    - Its a legal agreement to have the option to perform a security audit at any time
    - All parties agrees to the terms and conditions

- Supply Chain Analysis
    - Determine if there are vulnerabilities in the supply chain process

- Due Diligence
    - Checking  a company out before doing business
    - Involves investigating and verifying information like financial status, pending or past legal issues, etc.

- Conflict of Interest
    - A personal interest could compromise judgement like potential partner also does business with your largest competitor 

- Questionnaires
    - Questions for the third party to asses and verify they are being thorough with your data (i.e. plans in place for disaster recovery, vendors due diligence)
