# Security Policies
- Security policies answer the "what" and "why" questions. The technical security controls answer "how"

- <u>Information Security Policies</u>: big list of all security guidelines
    - Need to follow compliance requirements
    - Answers the question "What happens when..."
    - They need to be enforced

- <u>Acceptable Use Policies (AUP)</u>: set of rules that explain what employees are allowed and not allowed to do when using the company's computers, internet, and other tech resources
    - Includes topics like internet use, computers, mobile devices, etc.
    - Used by an organization for legal issues to protect themselves (if needed)

- <u>Business continuity</u>: an alternative plan should the main process not working properly
    - Needs to be created and tested before an issue occurs

- Incident Response Roles
    - Incident response team
    - IT security management (i.e. corporate support)
    - Compliance officers (i.e. intricate knowledge of compliance rules)
    - Technical staff (i.e. the team doing the fixing)
    - Users

- Change Management
    - This could be software upgrade, change firewall configurations, modify switch ports, etc.


# Security Standards
-  Standards can be custom or already written
    - ISO and NIST are pre-written standards

- Access Control
    - Determines which information and at what time and under what circumstances a user can access something
    - Require privilege documentation

- Physical Security
    - ID cards
    - Escorts
    - Doors, building access, proper security

- Encryption
    - Store passwords in a specific method or technique (i.e. specific hash)
    - Data in transit and data in use need specific encryption compared to encryption for storing passwords


# Security Procedures
- <u>Playbook</u>: step by step processes and procedures for specific situations (i.e. investigate a data breach, recover from ransomware)

- Updating monitoring and revision processes since IT is always changing
    - Update security playbooks
    - Change the individual procedures
    - Protect against new threats


# Security Considerations
- Regulations
    - Regulations are usually mandated (i.e. HIPAA)

- Legal
    - The security team must follow legal guidelines  (i.e. keeping data within a certain region)

- Industry
    - Each industry may require specific security considerations (i.e. Accessing electrical power and public utilities information)
    - Medical has high secure data storage and access logs
        - Data encryption and protection


# Data Roles and Responsibilities
- Data Owner
    - The person or department who decides who can access the data, how the data is used, and the protections needed for it (i.e. CFO is the data owner of all financial records)

- Data Controller
    - The entity that determines why and how the data is collected and processed (i.e. An online retailer determines what customer info to collect like name, address, payment details)

- Data Processor
    - The 3rd party or system that handles/processes the data on behalf of the controller (i.e. A cloud provider that stores and manages customer data)

- Data custodian/steward
    - The IT role that directly works with the data. They implement and enforce policies (i.e. A database admin)


# Risk Management
- Risk management helps to understand potential risks and identify weaknesses before they become an issue


# Risk Analysis
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence
    - It determines how often a risk will happen in 1 year

- <u>Risk appetite</u>: an organization's overall willingness to accept a risk to achieve its goals (the mindset or amount of risk you're willing to take on)

- <u>Risk Tolerance</u>: the specific limits or boundaries of the risk appetite (the number or actual value of risk you're willing to take on)


- <u>Qualitative Risk Analysis</u>: method of assessing risk based on potential impact and likelihood without assigning a numerical value

- <u>Quantitative Risk Analysis</u>: method of evaluating risk using numerical measurements

- <u>Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)</u>: amount of money expected to be lost  in a single event
    - Formula: $Asset Value * Exposure Factor% = SLE

- <u>Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)</u>: amount of money expected to be lost  in a single event
    - Formula: SLE * ARO = ALE

# Risk Management Strategies
- Transfer
    - Move the risk to another party (i.e. Buy cybersecurity insurance)

- Accept
    - Accept the risk

- Accept with exemption
    - i.e. A security policy can not be followed

- Accept with exception
    - i.e. Internal security policies are not applied

- Risk reporting
    - Document with a list of all the risks the organization is tracking
    - Its for senior management
    - Includes critical and emerging risks


# Business Impact Analysis
<u> Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</u>: the max acceptable amount of time to restore a system or process after a disaster or failure

<u> Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</u>: the max acceptable amount of data loss measured in time

<u>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</u>: average time to repair a system or component. Includes diagnosing and everything related to the issue

<u>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</u>: the average time between failures of a system or component during operation


# Third Party Risk Assessment
- Pen testing
    - Its similar to a vulnerability scan
    - Often a compliance mandate
    - A 3rd party can specialize in pen testing
    - The Rules of Engagement defines purpose and scope of a pen test and what is not in scope (i.e. IP addresses, emergency contacts, devices, etc.)

- Right to Audit
    - Its a legal agreement to have the option to perform a security audit at any time
    - All parties agrees to the terms and conditions

- Supply Chain Analysis
    - Determine if there are vulnerabilities in the supply chain process

- Due Diligence
    - Checking  a company out before doing business
    - Involves investigating and verifying information like financial status, pending or past legal issues, etc.

- Conflict of Interest
    - A personal interest could compromise judgement like a potential partner also does business with your largest competitor 

- Questionnaires
    - Questions for the third party to asses and verify they are being thorough with your data (i.e. plans in place for disaster recovery, vendors due diligence)


# Agreement Types
<u>Service Level Agreement</u>: standard of service a client can expect from a provider (i.e. uptime, response time agreement, etc.)  
    - A Contract with an internet provider would mean the SLA is no more than 4 hours of unscheduled downtime

<u>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</u>: outlines a mutual agreement on project goals. Often the first step toward collaboration.
    - Its not a contract
    - It states common goals and nothing else

<u>Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)</u>: document outlining specific responsibilities and roles of involved parties
    - More details than a MOU

<u>Master Service Agreement (MSA)</u>: Legal contract that sets the terms and conditions for a long term relationship
    - A broad framework to cover later transactions
    - Many detailed transactions happen here
    - Future projects will be based on this agreement

<u>Work Order (WO)/ Statement of Work (SOW)</u>: specifies the details of work to be done (i.e. details of the job, location, deliverables schedule, acceptance criteria, etc.)
    - Used with the MSA

<u>Business Partners Agreement (BPA)</u>: a document that explains the money details and ownership share involved when two or more parties go into business together
    - Contains who makes the business decisions
    - Financial issue
    - Disaster recovery


# Compliance
- Internal
    - Monitor and report on organizational compliance efforts
    - Large organizations have a Central Compliance Officer (CCO)

- External
    - Documentation required by external or industry regulators


# Privacy
- Local/Regional (state and local governments)
    - i.e. Vehicle registration
- National (i.e. HIPAA, COPPA)
- Global
    - Many countries are working together for privacy
    - <u>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</u>: data protection and privacy for individuals in the EU
        - Gives power back to the subject to decide how their data can be used ("A right to be forgotten")
        

# Audit and Assessments
- Cybersecurity Audit
    - It lets you examine the IT infrastructure, software, devices, etc.
    - Checks for effectiveness of policies and procedures
    - Find vulnerabilities before the attackers

- <u>Attestation</u>: providing an opinion of a companies's security position. A 3rd party generally attests to a companies' security posture after testing the system
    - An auditor will attest to a company's cybersecurity posture

- <u>Audit Committee</u>: internal committee overseeing an organization's internal controls, financial reporting and compliance

# Penetration Tests
- OS security can be bypassed by physical means
    - Accessing devices can be done by first accessing a door, window, elevator, etc.

- Known environment
    - Full disclosure of information to the pen tester

- Partially Known environment
    - A mix of known and unknown of information to the pen tester

- Unknown environment
    - The pen tester knows nothing about the systems under attack aka Blind Test

- Reconnaissance
    - Pen tester gathers as much information before attacking
    - Understand the security configurations, firewalls, etc.
    - Focus on a particular part of the system
    - Create a network map to see where routers, networks, and remote sites are located and connected to each other

- <u>Passive Reconnaissance</u>: gathering information about an a organization without network interaction
    - Use social media, corporate websites, online forums, social engineering, dumpster dive, or speak with business organizations that interact with the target

- <u>Active Reconnaissance</u>: directly interacting with a target system to gather information
    - Trying doors, ping and port scans, DNS queries, OS scans, OS fingerprinting, service and version scans


# Security Awareness
- <u>Phishing Campaigns</u>: testing members of an organization if they will click on a phishing attack by sending a phishing an attack
    - It can be an automated process
    - Many companies will do their own campaigns
    - Signs of a phishing attempt
        1. Spelling and grammar mistakes
        2. Domain name and email inconsistencies
        3. Unusual attachments
        4. Request for personal info


# User Training
- Policy/Handbooks
    - Document all security requirements

- Situational Awareness
    - Users should always be looking for threats. Software (i.e. email links, attachments, test messages, etc.) and physical (i.e. USB drives in a FedEx envelope, unlocked building doors, etc.) threats

- User Guidance and training
    - Insider threats
    - Password management
    - Removable media and cables
    - Social engineering
    - Operational security(view security from attackers perspective)
    - Hybrid/remote work environments
